- üì∏ Photo and video capture with thermal overlays
- üìä Temperature data analysis and reporting
- üîÑ Multi-device support and connectivity
- üì± User account management and data sync
- üè† Home dashboard with device status
- üé• Video playback and analysis tools
- üìÑ PDF report generation

## Repository Structure

For detailed information about the project structure and what each folder contains, see [FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md](FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md).

## Architecture

The project follows a modular Android architecture:

- **Main App**: Core application logic and UI
- **libapp**: Shared library with common functionality
- **Components**: Feature-specific modules (thermal imaging, user management, etc.)
- **Device Libraries**: Hardware-specific integrations

## Build Variants

The application supports multiple build variants:

- **Google Play**: Consumer version
- **Topdon**: OEM version
- **Regional**: China and international variants
- **Environment**: Development, beta, and production builds
