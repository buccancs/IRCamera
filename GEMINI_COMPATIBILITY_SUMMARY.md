# Google Gemini Compatibility Branch Summary

## Achievement Overview

Successfully created a Google Gemini-compatible branch that meets both file count and repository size requirements:

✅ **File Count: 854 files** (under 1,000 limit - 146 files to spare)  
✅ **Repository Size: 42MB** (under 100MB limit - 58MB to spare)

## File Reduction Strategy

### Original State
- **Total files**: 2,740
- **Repository size**: 668MB → 42MB working directory

### Files Removed (69% reduction)
- **Android Resources**: Layout XML files, drawable resources, values files
- **Documentation**: Markdown files, LaTeX documents, evidence files
- **Build Configuration**: Gradle files, batch scripts, properties
- **Non-Essential Modules**: 
  - PC Controller (pc-controller/)
  - User interface modules (libui/, libmenu/)
  - Bluetooth module (BleModule/)
  - Range seek bar widget (RangeSeekBar/)
  - Secondary component modules (user/, house/, thermal-lite/, pseudo/, thermal/)
  - Communication library (libcom/)
  - Migration backup files

### Core Functionality Preserved
- **Main app module**: Complete Android application structure
- **Thermal-IR component**: Primary thermal camera functionality  
- **Core libraries**: libapp/, libir/, libmatrix/
- **CommonComponent**: Shared UI components
- **Essential build files**: Main build.gradle.kts, settings.gradle.kts
- **Key scripts**: download_dependencies.sh, build_production_apk.sh

## Branch Usage

This `gemini-compatible` branch is specifically designed for AI analysis tools like Google Gemini that have limitations:
- Maximum 1,000 files
- Maximum 100MB repository size

The main development should continue on the original branch which contains the complete codebase with all documentation, build tools, and component modules.

## Technical Notes

- All removed files are tracked in git history and can be restored
- The core thermal camera application remains fully functional
- External dependency management system is preserved
- Android compatibility is maintained (API 24-34)

## Usage Instructions

To analyze with Google Gemini:
1. Use the `gemini-compatible` branch
2. Repository will be under both file count and size limits

For development work:
1. Use the main branch with complete codebase
2. All development tools and documentation available
