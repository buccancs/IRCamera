# Repository Size Optimization Report

## Current Status

### Size Progress
- **Original size**: 668MB (from PR description)
- **Current size**: 305MB
- **Total reduction**: 363MB (54% reduction)
- **Target**: Under 100MB
- **Remaining reduction needed**: ~205MB

### Optimization Actions Completed

#### 1. Large AAR Dependencies (Previous commits)
- ✅ Removed `lms_international-3.90.009.0.aar` (44MB)
- ✅ Removed `libAC020sdk_USB_IR_1.1.1_2408291439.aar` 
- ✅ Removed entire `libhik` module (55MB)
- ✅ Removed many native libraries from `libapp/src/main/jniLibs/`

#### 2. Additional Large Dependencies (This commit)
- ✅ Moved `libusbdualsdk_1.3.4_2406271906_standard.aar` (7.8MB) to external deps
- ✅ Moved `libcommon_1.2.0_24052117.aar` (4.1MB) to external deps
- ✅ Moved `auth-number-2.13.2.1.aar` (1.2MB) to external deps

#### 3. Large Asset Files 
- ✅ Moved `TS004.pdf` (3.6MB) to external deps
- ✅ Moved `TC001.pdf` (1.9MB) to external deps

#### 4. Resource Optimization
- ✅ Removed large drawable resources: `ic_report_bg_top.png` (364KB), `ic_main_connect_bg.webp` (308KB)
- ✅ Removed x86/x86_64 native libraries (2.5MB) - not needed for most Android devices

### External Dependency Management

#### Dependencies now downloaded at build time:
- `library_1.0.aar`
- `suplib-release.aar` 
- `ai-upscale-release.aar`
- `libusbdualsdk_1.3.4_2406271906_standard.aar` (7.8MB)
- `lms_international-3.90.009.0.aar` (44MB)
- `auth-number-2.13.2.1.aar` (1.2MB)
- `libAC020sdk_USB_IR_1.1.1_2408291439.aar`
- `libcommon_1.2.0_24052117.aar` (4.1MB)

#### Assets now downloaded at build time:
- `TS004.pdf` (3.6MB)
- `TC001.pdf` (1.9MB)
- `ic_report_bg_top.png` (364KB)
- `ic_main_connect_bg.webp` (308KB)
- x86 architecture libraries (optional, 2.5MB)

## Next Strategic Actions

### Immediate Actions (to reach under 200MB)
1. **Git History Optimization** (Major impact: ~264MB potential)
   - The `.git` directory is 264MB (87% of current repo size)
   - Consider git history cleanup for removed large files
   - Could use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner

2. **Documentation Optimization** (4.3MB)
   - Move large documentation images/assets to external storage
   - Consider LFS for binary documentation assets

3. **Component Assets Review** (11MB)
   - Review `component/thermal-ir` for additional large assets
   - Move binary firmware files to external dependencies

### Medium Priority Actions (to reach under 100MB)
1. **Build Output Cleanup**
   - Ensure no build artifacts are committed
   - Clean up any temporary files

2. **Dependency Deduplication**
   - Review for duplicate libraries across modules
   - Consolidate common dependencies

## Implementation Notes

### Build Configuration Updates
- Updated `download_dependencies.sh` to handle new external dependencies
- Modified `app/build.gradle.kts`, `libir/build.gradle.kts`, `libapp/build.gradle.kts`
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude external dependencies
- Added conditional dependency loading in build scripts

### Compatibility Maintained
- All essential functionality preserved
- AAR dependencies loaded conditionally at build time
- Fallback mechanisms for missing optional dependencies
- x86 libraries available as optional download

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Changes ✅
- External dependency management (completed)
- Asset externalization (completed)
- x86 library removal (completed)

### Medium Risk Changes ⚠️
- Git history cleanup (requires careful planning)
- Documentation restructuring

### Success Metrics
- Repository clone time improvement
- CI/CD pipeline efficiency
- Developer onboarding experience
- Build time impact (should be minimal due to dependency caching)
