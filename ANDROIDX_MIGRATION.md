# AndroidX Support Status

## Current Status

✅ **AndroidX Support Enabled**: The project is fully configured to use AndroidX libraries
- `android.useAndroidX=true` - AndroidX packages are used
- `android.enableJetifier=true` - Third-party libraries are automatically converted to AndroidX
- All AndroidX dependencies are properly resolved and compatible

✅ **ExoPlayer AndroidX Issues Fixed**: 
- ExoPlayer mixed AndroidX/support library jetifier warnings resolved
- Consistent ExoPlayer 2.19.1 versions enforced across all modules
- Dependency conflicts eliminated

## Known Deprecation Warnings

⚠️ **kotlin-android-extensions Plugin**: The project currently uses `kotlin-android-extensions` plugin which is deprecated as of Kotlin 1.4.20. This plugin provides:
- Synthetic view properties (kotlinx.android.synthetic.*)
- @Parcelize annotation support

### Migration Plan

**Phase 1** (Completed):
- [x] Ensure AndroidX compatibility across all modules
- [x] Fix ExoPlayer AndroidX/support library conflicts
- [x] Optimize build configuration for AndroidX

**Phase 2** (Future Release):
- [ ] Replace `kotlin-android-extensions` with `kotlin-parcelize` for Parcelable support
- [ ] Migrate synthetic view imports to View Binding
- [ ] Update all view access patterns to use findViewById() or View Binding

## Build Performance Optimizations

✅ **Enhanced AndroidX Support**:
- Incremental annotation processing enabled
- R8 full mode enabled for better optimization
- Parallel builds enabled for better performance
- Configuration on demand enabled

## Notes

The deprecation warnings for `kotlin-android-extensions` do not affect functionality or AndroidX compatibility. The project builds successfully and all AndroidX features work correctly. The migration to View Binding will be implemented in a future release to maintain code stability.
