# IRCamera PC Controller - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation provides the PC-side controller for the IRCamera multi-modal recording system, following the requirements document specifications. The system implements a hub-and-spoke architecture where the PC acts as the central controller coordinating multiple Android recording devices.

## Implemented Components

### âœ… Core Architecture (Requirements Met)

1. **Session Manager** (`src/ircamera_pc/core/session.py`)
   - **Requirement FR4**: Session Management with unique IDs and metadata
   - Creates discrete sessions with timestamps and metadata
   - Handles complete session lifecycle (create â†’ start â†’ record â†’ end)
   - Persists session data as JSON with file manifest
   - Supports only one active session at a time
   - Tracks devices, files, and synchronization events per session

2. **Network Server** (`src/ircamera_pc/network/server.py`)
   - **Requirement FR2**: Synchronised Multi-Modal Recording
   - **Requirement FR7**: Device Synchronisation and Signals
   - JSON/TCP/IP communication protocol for Android devices
   - Device registration and heartbeat monitoring
   - Broadcast commands for synchronized start/stop
   - GSR leader election and management
   - Fault tolerance with automatic reconnection
   - Sync flash and sync mark signal broadcasting

3. **Time Synchronization Service** (`src/ircamera_pc/core/timesync.py`)
   - **Requirement FR3**: Time Synchronisation Service

   - Tracks synchronization quality metrics (median/p95 offsets)
   - Target: â‰¤5ms median offset, â‰¤15ms p95 offset
   - Device-specific sync statistics and monitoring
   - UDP-based protocol for low latency

4. **Configuration Management** (`src/ircamera_pc/core/config.py`)
   - YAML-based configuration system
   - Runtime configuration updates and persistence  
   - Dot-notation access to nested settings
   - Default fallbacks for missing configuration

5. **GUI Framework** (`src/ircamera_pc/gui/`)

   - PyQt5-based researcher interface
   - Device list with real-time status indicators
   - Session control widgets (start/stop/new)
   - System status displays and logging
   - Sync control buttons (flash/mark)
   - Modular widget architecture

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

#### Message Protocol

- Complete metadata tracking:
  - Device information and capabilities
  - File manifest with checksums
  - Synchronization events timeline
  - Session duration and states
- JSON metadata persistence with human-readable format

#### Time Synchronization
- UDP-based protocol for minimal latency
- Device offset tracking and statistics
- Quality monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Support for up to 100 recent offset measurements per device

#### Architecture Patterns
- Hub-and-spoke topology as specified
- Event-driven design with callback system
- Modular component architecture
- Async/await patterns for network operations
- Configuration-driven behavior
